Below will be the explanation for the code which involves the use of an arudino mega microcontroller in C++.

The arduino mega controls 
1. speaker volume 
2. sd card module
3. WS2812B led strips of light

While doing the C++ code for this project, I learnt several concepts that were crucial to the success of the project.
1. multithreading 
2. memory management
